## About the project:

This application is to create and record blog posts for the user

## Getting Started:

To begin, type "node server.js" or "npm start" into the terminal. It currently will not work. The backend was working but somehow I broke it, now I can't solve the current error. I don't understand why sequelize will not initiate for the models/User.js file on line 9 or line 1 on models/index.js.

## Languages:

Javascript, mysql,
